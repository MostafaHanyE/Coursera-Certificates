In this specialization, I learnt the major functions that must be performed by a battery management system, 
how lithium-ion battery cells work and how to model their behaviors mathematically, and how to write algorithms (computer methods) to estimate state-of-charge,
state-of-health, remaining energy, and available power, and how to balance cells in a battery pack.
